# lossscript
Is this loss: the language

Lossscript is based on [oOo](https://esolangs.org/wiki/OOo_CODE), but with | and I instead of upper and lowercase characters.

Each group of three | or I characters is one instruction, with I being 1 and | being 0 in oOo.

Each pair of instructions is seperated to form loss, with spacing and a _ at the end.

Example code can be found in helloworld

Guide:

```> = |||
< = ||I
[ = |I|
] = |II
- = I||
+ = I|I
. = II|
, = III
